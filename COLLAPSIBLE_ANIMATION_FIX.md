# Collapsible Component - Animation Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Smooth Animation on Every Toggle** ✅

**Problem**: Initial state worked smoothly, but after the first toggle, animations became jerky or instant.

**Root Cause**:

- Content was completely unmounted (`return null`) when closed
- Height was set to "auto" too early, preventing smooth collapse
- Double `requestAnimationFrame` wasn't used for closing animation

**Solution**:

```tsx
// Added isAnimating state to track animation progress
const [isAnimating, setIsAnimating] = useState(false);

// Keep element in DOM during animation
const shouldRender = open || forceMount || isAnimating;

// Proper height management for opening
if (open) {
  setIsAnimating(true);
  const contentHeight = contentRef.current.scrollHeight;
  setHeight(contentHeight);

  // Set to auto AFTER animation completes
  const timer = setTimeout(() => {
    setHeight("auto");
    setIsAnimating(false);
  }, animationDuration);
}

// Proper height management for closing
else {
  setIsAnimating(true);
  const currentHeight = contentRef.current.scrollHeight;
  setHeight(currentHeight);

  // Double requestAnimationFrame ensures browser paints before animating to 0
  requestAnimationFrame(() => {
    requestAnimationFrame(() => {
      setHeight(0);
    });
  });

  const timer = setTimeout(() => {
    setIsAnimating(false);
  }, animationDuration);
}
```

### 2. **Icon Rotation Smoothness** ✅

**Problem**: Icon rotation needed better transition timing.

**Solution**:

```tsx
// Before
["transition-transform duration-200", "shrink-0"][
  // After
  ("transition-all duration-300 ease-in-out", "shrink-0", "transform")
];
```

**Changes**:

- Increased duration from 200ms to 300ms for smoother rotation
- Changed from `transition-transform` to `transition-all` for better compatibility
- Added `ease-in-out` timing function for smoother start/end
- Added explicit `transform` class

### 3. **Better Animation Timing Functions** ✅

**Problem**: Animation types (smooth, spring, bounce) weren't properly differentiated.

**Solution**:

```tsx
const getTimingFunction = () => {
  switch (animation) {
    case "smooth":
      return "ease-in-out";
    case "spring":
      return "cubic-bezier(0.68, -0.55, 0.265, 1.55)";
    case "bounce":
      return "cubic-bezier(0.68, -0.6, 0.32, 1.6)";
    case "none":
      return "linear";
    default:
      return "ease-in-out";
  }
};

// Apply to transition
transition: animation === "none"
  ? "none"
  : `height ${animationDuration}ms ${getTimingFunction()}`;
```

### 4. **Removed Conflicting CSS Animations** ✅

**Problem**: CSS keyframe animations (`animate-collapsible-up`, `animate-collapsible-down`) conflicted with inline style transitions.

**Before**:

```tsx
[
  "overflow-hidden",
  "transition-all",
  "data-[state=closed]:animate-collapsible-up",
  "data-[state=open]:animate-collapsible-down",
];
```

**After**:

```tsx
["overflow-hidden"];
// Height animation handled by inline styles for better control
```

## Files Modified

1. **`src/components/Collapsible/index.tsx`**

   - Added `isAnimating` state tracking
   - Improved height animation logic with double `requestAnimationFrame`
   - Added dynamic timing function based on animation type
   - Changed render logic to keep element in DOM during animation

2. **`src/components/Collapsible/Collapsible.styles.ts`**
   - Updated icon transition from 200ms to 300ms with `ease-in-out`
   - Removed conflicting CSS animation classes from content
   - Simplified content variants to avoid conflicts with inline styles

## Animation Behavior Now

### Opening Animation

1. Element starts with `height: 0`
2. `isAnimating` set to `true`
3. Height set to calculated `scrollHeight`
4. CSS transition animates from 0 to calculated height
5. After animation completes, height set to `"auto"` for responsive content
6. `isAnimating` set to `false`

### Closing Animation

1. Element starts with `height: "auto"`
2. `isAnimating` set to `true`
3. Height explicitly set to current `scrollHeight` (in pixels)
4. Browser paints with explicit height (first `requestAnimationFrame`)
5. Height set to `0` (second `requestAnimationFrame`)
6. CSS transition animates from calculated height to 0
7. After animation completes, `isAnimating` set to `false`
8. Element hidden (but kept in DOM if animating)

### Icon Rotation

- Smooth 300ms rotation with `ease-in-out`
- Rotates 180° when open (ChevronDown becomes ChevronUp)
- Synchronized with content animation duration

## Testing

Build Status: ✅ **Successful**

- No compilation errors
- Component size: 6.53 kB (was 5.76 kB - slight increase due to better animation logic)
- Styles size: 5.81 kB (was 6.02 kB - decreased due to simplified CSS)

## Usage Example

```tsx
// All animations now work smoothly on every toggle
<Collapsible variant="glass" animation="spring">
  <CollapsibleTrigger>
    Toggle Me (Icon rotates smoothly)
  </CollapsibleTrigger>
  <CollapsibleContent>
    <div className="p-4">
      Content animates smoothly every time!
    </div>
  </CollapsibleContent>
</Collapsible>

// Test all animation types
<Collapsible animation="smooth">   {/* ease-in-out */}
<Collapsible animation="spring">   {/* cubic-bezier spring */}
<Collapsible animation="bounce">   {/* cubic-bezier bounce */}
<Collapsible animation="none">     {/* instant, no animation */}
```

## Benefits

1. ✅ **Consistent Animation**: Same smooth behavior on every toggle
2. ✅ **No Jank**: Proper `requestAnimationFrame` usage prevents layout shifts
3. ✅ **Better Performance**: Element stays in DOM during animation, avoiding re-mounts
4. ✅ **Responsive**: Height set to "auto" after animation for dynamic content
5. ✅ **Smooth Icons**: 300ms rotation with ease-in-out timing
6. ✅ **Customizable**: Different timing functions for each animation type
7. ✅ **No Conflicts**: Removed conflicting CSS animations
