# Calendar Range Selection - Quick Fix Summary

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### Issue

Calendar range mode only showed start and end dates clearly, but dates in between had no visual indication.

### Solution

Enhanced the Calendar component to show **complete range visualization**:

1. **Start Date** - Full primary color highlight with rounded left edge
2. **In-Range Dates** - Light primary background (20% opacity) with connecting band
3. **End Date** - Full primary color highlight with rounded right edge
4. **Visual Continuity** - Connected appearance showing continuous selection

## 🎨 Works With All Variants

- ✅ **Default** - Clean card design
- ✅ **Bordered** - Enhanced borders
- ✅ **Glass** - Frosted glass effect
- ✅ **Glass Strong** - Enhanced glass
- ✅ **Gradient** - Gradient shimmer

## 📝 Code Changes

### File: `src/components/Calendar/index.tsx`

**1. Enhanced Day Variants (Lines ~78-142)**

- Added `inRange` state with light primary background and connecting overlay
- Modified `rangeStart` with connection extending to the right
- Modified `rangeEnd` with connection extending to the left
- Added `rangeBoth` for single-day ranges

**2. Fixed State Detection Logic (Lines ~468-498)**

- Improved range detection to properly identify start, end, and in-between dates
- Added special case for same-day start/end selection
- Ensures `inRange` state is applied to middle dates

### File: `src/examples/CalendarExample.tsx`

**Enhanced Range Section (Lines ~153-263)**

- Added all 5 variants side-by-side for comparison
- Added range info card showing start date, end date, and duration
- Improved labeling and user guidance

## 🎯 Visual Result

```
Before:
[Start] [ ] [ ] [ ] [End]   ❌ Middle dates unclear

After:
[Start]━━━━━━━━━━━[End]     ✅ Clear continuous range
```
